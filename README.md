# Lista de tarefas

Como normalmente sempre faço uma lista de tarefas para cada tech que aprendo, com react não foi diferente.

# Usando componentes

Essa lista de tarefas foi criada usando funcões components do react. Usando components separados, como a lógica da lista em um component separado(percorrer um array e rederizar na tela), como também o alerta e o input, somente as div's que estruturam no App que liga no index.js.

# useState

Lidei com state de cada váriavel, ou seja, o state atualizava o valor que seria percorrido por um map, onde é possível mostrar cada tarefa.

# useRef

Lidando com o useRef para pegar o valor de um input

# Lógicas

O usuário não pode acrescentar uma tarefa sem nada no input e quando adicionar aparece um aviso.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
